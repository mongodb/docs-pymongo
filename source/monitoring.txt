Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure **monitoring** in {+driver-short+}.
Monitoring is the process of gathering information about your
application's performance and resource usage as it runs.
This can help you make informed decisions when designing and debugging your application.

The driver provides information about your application by emitting events. You can
listen for driver events to monitor your application.

.. note:: Event Logging

   This page explains how to monitor your application in code. To learn how to record
   this information to an external log, see :ref:`Logging. <pymongo-logging>`

Event Types
-----------

The type of event that the driver emits depends on the operation being performed.
The following table describes the types of events that the driver emits:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Event Type
     - Description
   * - Command Events
     - Events related to MongoDB database commands, such as ``find``, ``insert``,
       ``delete``, and ``count``. To learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to run a
       database command, see :ref:`<pymongo-run-command>`. For more information about
       MongoDB database commands, see :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>`
       in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

       As a security measure, the driver redacts the contents of some
       command events. This protects the sensitive information contained in these command
       events.

   * - Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) Events
     - Events related to changes in the state of the MongoDB deployment.

   * - Connection Pool Events
     - Events related to the connection pool held by the driver.

For a copmlete list of events the driver emits, see the
`pymongo.monitoring <{+api-root+}pymongo/monitoring.html>`__ API documentation.
