Overview
--------

In this guide you can learn how to specify which documents to return from a read
operation by using the following methods:

- ``limit()``: specifies a maximum number of documents to return from a query.
- ``sort()``: specifies a sort order for the returned documents.
- ``skip()``: specifies an amount of document to skip before returning query results.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :ref:`<pymongo-get-started>`.

Limit
-----

You can specify the maximum amount of documents returned from a read operation,
by calling the ``limit()`` method.

The following example finds all restaurants that have a ``cuisine`` field value
of ``"Italian"`` and limits the results to 5 documents:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-method
      :end-before: end-limit-method
      :language: python

   .. output::

      Isle Of Capri Resturant Italian
      Arturo'S Italian
      Patsy'S Italian Restaurant Italian
      Piccola Venezia Italian
      Roadhouse Restaurant Italian

You can also limit the amount of returned documents by specifying the ``limit``
option in your ``find()`` method:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-option
      :end-before: end-limit-option
      :language: python

   .. output::

      Isle Of Capri Resturant Italian
      Arturo'S Italian
      Patsy'S Italian Restaurant Italian
      Piccola Venezia Italian
      Roadhouse Restaurant Italian

The preceding examples return documents in no particular order, they only
limit the results to the first 5 documents returned by the query. The following
section describes how to return the documents returned in a specified
sort order.

Sort
----

To return documents in a specified order, call the ``sort()`` method. ``sort()``
takes two methods: the field to sort the results by, and a sort direction. To
specify the sort direction, specify either ``pymongo.ASCENDING`` or
``pymongo.DESCENDING``. ``ASCENDING`` sorts values from lowest to highest, and
``DESCENDING`` sorts them from highest to lowest. If you don't specify either
direction, the method defaults to sorting in ascending order.

The following example returns all documents with the ``cuisine`` value of
``"Italian"`` sorted in ascending order:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-method
      :end-before: end-limit-method
      :language: python

   .. output::

      ...
      Aria
      Armando'S Kitchen
      Armando'S Restaurant
      Armani Restaurant
      ...
      Zucchero E Pomodori

You can also sort documents by specifying the ``sort`` option in your ``find()``
method. The following example specifies the ``sort`` option to perform the same
query as the preceding example:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-option
      :end-before: end-limit-option
      :language: python

   .. output::

      ...
      Aria
      Armando'S Kitchen
      Armando'S Restaurant
      Armani Restaurant
      ...
      Zucchero E Pomodori

Skip
----

To skip a specified number of documents before returning your query results,
call the ``skip()`` method. 

The following example returns all documents that have a ``borough`` field value
of ``"Manhattan"`` and skips the first 10 documents:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-skip
      :end-before: end-skip
      :language: python

   .. output::

      Dorrian'S Red Hand Restaurant
      The Princeton Club
      Moran'S Chelsea
      La Parisienne Diner
      Jimmy'S Corner
      ...

You can also apply a ``skip`` by specifying as an
option to the ``find()`` method. The following example specifies the
same skip as the preceding example:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-skip-option
      :end-before: end-skip-option
      :language: python

   .. output::

      Dorrian'S Red Hand Restaurant
      The Princeton Club
      Moran'S Chelsea
      La Parisienne Diner
      Jimmy'S Corner
      ...

Combine Limit, Sort, and Skip
-----------------------------

You can combine the ``limit()``, ``sort()``, and ``skip()`` methods in a single
operation. This allows you to set a maximum number of sorted documents to
return, skipping a specified number of documents before returning.

The following example returns the documents with the ``cuisine`` value of
``"Italian"``. The results are sorted in alphabetical order, skipping the first
10 documents:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-sort-skip
      :end-before: end-limit-sort-skip
      :language: python

   .. output::
      
      Acqua
      Acqua Restaurant
      Acqua Santa
      Acquista Trattoria
      Acquolina Catering

.. note::

   The order in which you call these methods doesn't change the documents
   that are returned. The driver automatically reorders the calls to apply the
   sort and skip first and the limit after.

You can also apply ``limit``, ``sort`` and ``skip`` by specifying them as
options in the ``find()`` method. The following example specifies the
same query as the preceding example:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-documents-to-return.py
      :start-after: start-limit-sort-skip-option
      :end-before: end-limit-sort-skip-option
      :language: python

   .. output::
      
      Acqua
      Acqua Restaurant
      Acqua Santa
      Acquista Trattoria
      Acquolina Catering
