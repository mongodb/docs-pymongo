   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Before installing {+django-odm+}, ensure you have the following dependencies installed
      in your development environment:
      
      - `Python3 version 3.10 or later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
      - `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__

   .. step:: Create a virtual environment

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create and activate a virtual environment in which to install {+django-odm+}:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: mac-linux-venv

             .. code-block:: bash

                python3 -m venv venv
                source venv/bin/activate

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: windows-venv

             .. code-block:: bash

                python3 -m venv venv
                . venv\Scripts\activate

   .. step:: Install {+django-odm+}

      With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install
      the Django integration:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install git+https://github.com/mongodb-labs/django-mongodb

      This command also installs the following dependencies:

      - PyMongo version {+version-number+}
      - Django version {+django-version-number+}

      .. important::

         If you have already installed PyMongo and Django in your
         development environment, ensure that they fulfill the following
         version requirements:

         - PyMongo: Your version must be greater than or equal to 4.6 and less than 5.0.
         - Django: Your version must be greater than or equal to 5.0 and less than 5.1.


After you complete these steps, you have {+django-odm+} and its
dependencies installed in your development environment.
