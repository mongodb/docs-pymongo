Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to create an application that uses
{+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas. If
you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming
language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

{+driver-short+} is a library that you can use to connect
to and communicate with MongoDB.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to connect a sample Python application to
a MongoDB Atlas deployment.
