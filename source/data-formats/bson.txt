Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to create BSON documents, read BSON from a file, 
and write BSON to a file by using {+driver-short+}.

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, different size integers, ObjectIds, and
binary data. You can use BSON documents in your {+language+} application by including the
`bson <{+api-root+}bson/index.html>`__ package. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` server manual page.

The code samples in this guide use the following BSON document as an example:

.. code-block:: none

   {
       "address" : {
           "street" : "Pizza St", 
           "zipcode" : "10003" 
       },
       "coord" : [-73.982419, 41.579505]
       "cuisine" : "Pizza",
       "name" : "Mongo's Pizza"
   }

Create a BSON Document
----------------------

You can create a BSON document by using the same notation you use to create a
dictionary in {+language+}. {+driver-short+} automatically converts {+language+} dictionaries
into BSON documents when inserting them into a collection.

The following example creates a BSON document that
represents the preceding sample BSON document:

.. code-block:: python

   document = {
       "address": {
           "street": "Pizza St",
           "zipcode": "10003"
       },
       "coord": [-73.982419, 41.579505],
       "cuisine": "Pizza",
       "name": "Mongo's Pizza"
   }

Change a BSON Document
----------------------

You can modify the contents of a BSON document by using the same notation you use to modify
a dictionary in {+language+}. The following example makes three changes to the previous
BSON document:

1. Adds a new field, ``restaurant_id``, with the value ``12345``
#. Removes the ``cuisine`` field
#. Sets the value of the ``name`` field to ``"Mongo's Pizza Place"``

.. code-block:: python

   document["restaurant_id"] = 12345
   del document["cuisine"]
   document["name"] = "Mongo's Pizza Place"   

Write BSON to a File
--------------------

To write BSON data to a file, open a file stream in write-binary mode on the output file.
Then, write each document to the output file. Ensure that documents are encoded in BSON
format by using the ``bson.encode()`` method.

The following example writes the sample BSON document to ``file.bson``:

.. code-block:: python

   with open("file.bson", "w") as file:
       file.write(bson.encode(document))

Read BSON from a File
---------------------

To read BSON documents from a file, open a file stream in read-binary mode on the input
file. Then, decode the documents from BSON format as you read them by using the ``bson.decode()``
method.

The following example reads the sample BSON document from ``file.bson``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true
     
   .. input::
      :language: python

         with open("file.bson", "rb") as file:
             data = file.read()
             document = bson.decode(data)
             print(document)

   .. output::
      :visible: false
      
      {"address": {"street": "Pizza St", "zipcode": "10003"}, "coord": [-73.982419, 41.579505], "cuisine": "Pizza", "name": "Mongo's Pizza"}

Work with Raw BSON Data
-----------------------

{+driver-short+} supports the usage of raw BSON documents. The following list contains
some situations that might require using raw BSON documents:

- Moving a document between databases or collections
- Writing binary blobs to a disk
- Bypassing the performance overhead of converting to and from {+language+} dictionaries

You can use the ``RawBSONDocument`` class to represent raw BSON documents. To use
``RawBSONDocument`` objects to represent documents in your collection, set the
``document_class`` parameter of the ``MongoClient`` constructor to ``RawBSONDocument``.

The following example configures a ``MongoClient`` object to use ``RawBSONDocument``,
then retrieves the sample document:

.. code-block:: python
      
      from bson.raw_bson import RawBSONDocument

      client = pymongo.MongoClient("<connection URI>", document_class=RawBSONDocument)
      collection = client["<database name>"]["<collection name>"]
      raw_doc = collection.find_one({"name": "Mongo's Pizza"})

.. note::

   ``RawBSONDocument`` objects are read-only. To modify a ``RawBSONDocument``, you must
   first convert it to a {+language+} dictionary.
