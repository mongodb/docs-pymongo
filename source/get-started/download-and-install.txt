   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Ensure you have Python3 version 3.7 or later,
      pip, and dnspython installed in your development environment.

      For information about how to install pip, see the
      `pip Installation guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__.

      Support for ``mongodb+srv://`` connection URIs requires dnspython.
      For information about how to install dnspython, see the `dnspython
      PyPi project page <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``pymongo-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to create a file to contain your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         touch quickstart.py

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Run the following command in your shell to install
      the driver in your project directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ python3 -m pip install pymongo=={+patch-version-number+}

After you complete these steps, you have Python3, pip, dnspython, 
and a new project directory with the driver dependencies installed.
