   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Ensure you have the following dependencies installed
      in your development environment:
      
      - **Python3 version 3.7 or later.** To learn more about installing Python, see
        `Download Python. <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
      - **pip.** For information about how to install pip, see
        `Installation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__ in the pip
        documentation.
      - **dnspython.** Support for ``mongodb+srv://`` connection URIs requires dnspython.
        For information about how to install dnspython, see the `dnspython 
        <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/>`__ PyPi page.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``pymongo-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to create a file to contain your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         touch quickstart.py

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Run the following command in your shell to install
      the driver in your project directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ python3 -m pip install pymongo=={+patch-version-number+}

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.
