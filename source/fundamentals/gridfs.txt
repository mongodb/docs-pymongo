This guide shows how to use GridFS to store and retrieve large files
in MongoDB.

Setup
-----

Each ``GridFS`` instance operates on a specific MongoDB database.
To create a ``GridFS`` instance, call the ``GridFS()``
constructor and pass in a MongoDB database:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from pymongo import MongoClient
   >>> import gridfs
   >>>
   >>> db = MongoClient().gridfs_example
   >>> fs = gridfs.GridFS(db)

Saving and Retrieving Data
--------------------------

GridFS offers a key-value-pair interface through the ``~gridfs.GridFS.put()`` and
``~gridfs.GridFS.get()`` methods.

To write data to GridFS, use the ``~gridfs.GridFS.put()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> a = fs.put("hello world")

The ``~gridfs.GridFS.put()`` method creates a new file in GridFS, and returns
the value of the file's ``_id`` key. You can use the file's returned ``_id``
value to retrieve the contents of the file:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> fs.get(a).read()
   'hello world'

The ``~gridfs.GridFS.get()`` method returns a file-like object. To read the
file's contents, call the ``~gridfs.grid_file.GridOut.read()`` method. You can store
any object that has a ``read()`` method in GridFS.

The following code example shows how to add additional attributes to a file.
To add an attribute, pass it as a named argument to the ``~gridfs.GridFS.put()`` method.
To retrieve an attribute's value, call
the ``~gridfs.GridFS.get()`` method to retrieve the file-like object,
then use the attribute name to access each value on this object.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> b = fs.put(fs.get(a), filename="foo", bar="baz")
   >>> out = fs.get(b)
   >>> out.read()
   'hello world'
   >>> out.filename
   'foo'
   >>> out.bar
   'baz'
   >>> out.upload_date
   datetime.datetime(...)

.. note::

   Some attributes (for example, ``"filename"``) are GridFS keywords and can't be
   assigned values.
