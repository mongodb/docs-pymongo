To see how many documents are in a collection, use the
``~pymongo.collection.Collection.count_documents`` method.

To return a count off all documents in the collection, pass an empty object to
the ``count_documents()`` method, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >> posts.count_documents({})
   3

To return a count of documents that match a specific search criteria, specify a
query in the ``count_documents()`` method, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >> posts.count_documents({"author": "Mike"})
